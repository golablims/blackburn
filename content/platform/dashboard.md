In the dashboard of the app Golab you can take a quick look at the status of the samples status and patients status.
We have some indicators that give us a quick look at how many New Samples, Samples in Process, Samples in Review and Samples Rejected there are.
There is a bar chart that shows us the number of Samples created per week, a line graph for the status of those samples (ready, discarded, with issues), there are also pie charts of Patients per month, Samples per test type, etc.
